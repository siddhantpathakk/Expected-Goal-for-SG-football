# Creating an Expected Goal Model for Singapore football

## Abstract

This research paper presents a comprehensive exploration and evaluation of a bespoke Expected Goal (xG) model specifically designed for Singaporean football. The study addresses data quality and quantity challenges by utilizing an extensive dataset comprising spatial and temporal information from two seasons of English Premier League matches. Varied machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbours, Linear and Non-Support Vector Classifiers, Decision Trees, and a custom Deep Neural Network, are employed to calibrate the probabilistic models. Through fine-tuning, an ensemble model is proposed, achieving outstanding accuracy exceeding the 90% threshold on the test set.

To access the web-app,

1. Make sure a `*.h5` file is stored within the same directory as the `gradio_app.py`. Ensure the name of the file within the line 28 is same as the one of the model file to load it successfully using Keras API.
2. Run the following command in the terminal/powershell from the root of the project directory:
   ```console
   $ python scripts/gradio_app.py
   ```

## Results and Discussion

Some of the hyper-parameter optimization and selection curve for the right choice of activation function using the `deep-learning/finetune_*.py` script is shown below:

The results of performance for Level of Information 5 is shown below:

| Model                | Train Accuracy  |  Test Accuracy  |
| :------------------- | --------------- | :-------------: |
| Logistic Regression  | 0.584           |      0.608      |
| Decision Tree        | **0.995** | **0.992** |
| K-Nearest Neighbours | **0.995** | **0.993** |
| Linear SVC           | 0.603           |      0.628      |
| No-Support SVC       | 0.908           |      0.897      |
| Deep Neural Network  | **0.988** | **0.992** |

The research compares the performance of various machine learning models, indicating that K-Nearest Neighbors, No-Support SVC, and Decision Trees outperform Logistic Regression and Linear SVC in capturing non-linear relationships and handling complex decision boundaries. Custom neural networks are considered superior to traditional models, as they automatically extract intricate patterns and features from data, achieving higher predictive accuracy and scalability. Additionally, ELU with He-normal initialization outperforms other variants, enhancing deep neural network learning. The study highlights data shift in football over time, necessitating retraining models for relevance.

Ensemble learning, a powerful technique combining diverse models, is proposed for improved prediction accuracy and robustness.

However, implementation is beyond the scope of this research due to time constraints.

## Conclusion

This research paper elucidates the development and evaluation of a bespoke Expected Goal (xG) model catered to the nuances of Singaporean football. By harnessing an exhaustive dataset from two seasons of English Premier League matches, the study overcomes data challenges and proposes an ensemble model with exemplary accuracy. The model's applications in the sports industry are extensive and impactful, enabling strategic decisions for coaches and analysts related to player positioning, attacking patterns, and defensive strategies. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning methodologies in handling data paucity, offering valuable insights for resource-constrained contexts in various sporting domains. The proposed methodology has the potential to revolutionize performance analysis and decision-making in sports, making valuable contributions to the field of machine learning in football and providing a solid foundation for future scholarly inquiries. A locally-hosted Gradio-based simple website was developed for testing purposes, presenting a user-friendly interface with efficient back-end model integration.
